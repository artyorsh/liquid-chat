## Features

- On-device LLMs via Apple Foundation Models or MLC LLM Engine.
- AI-generated chat topics and group conversations.
- Light and Dark themes with flexible customization.
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions and EAS.
- Modularized architecture with Dependency Injection.

## Requirements

- For Apple Foundation Models, MacOS 26 with Xcode 26 are required.
- No above restrictions for MLC models. However, [testing is limited](#running).

## Setup

Install [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/homebrew-bun#install).

```bash
bun i
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# (Optionally) update the EXPO_PUBLIC_AI_FALLBACK_MODEL
```

## Running

Start Metro bundler and follow the instructions in terminal to run the app.

```bash
bun run start
```

### Android

Pre-built MLC models aren't available for Android making the platform not testable at the moment.
Follow [callstackincubator/ai](https://github.com/callstackincubator/ai?tab=readme-ov-file#mlc-engine-experimental) for updates.

### iOS

MLC models require a physical device, making them not testable on Simulator.
As a workaround, it's possible to run on Mac or a physical device.

**Mac / Physical device**:
- Build Xcode project: `npx expo prebuild` > `open ios/liquidchat.xcworkspace`
- Adjust Signing & Capabilities with your Personal Team

**Simulator**:
- Remove MLC deps: `bun rm @react-native-ai/mlc` > `npx expo prebuild --clean` > then adjust the [ai/index](src/ai/index.ts) to always return AppleAIProvider.
